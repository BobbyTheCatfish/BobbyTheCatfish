ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @BobbyTheCatfish

I'm the current team lead for the [Icarus Discord Bot](https://github.com/LDS-Gamers-Studios/icarus5.5) over at [LDS Gamers](https://ldsgamers.com). Right now we're focusing on migrating all of the features from the previous version to a new version of the Discord.js framework.

I also run a bot framework called [Augurbot-TS](https://github.com/BobbyTheCatfish/augurbot) which allows for type safe development with the D.JS framework.

Side projects also include scripting and automation of model swapping and event editing for Persona 5 Royal, and building dynamic websites with React.
My main language is Node JS, but I have some experience in Python and C#.
